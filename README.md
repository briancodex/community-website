# Let's build a website together! 

I've had this idea for a while now where people can submit pieces of code that end up turning into an amazing website. 
## Summary

I created a basic template where all you need to do is add code. Just submit a pull request and once I approved it, your code will show up. 

If you don't know how to submit a pull request, simply search it on Youtube and you'll find a lot of tutorials showing how to do it.

Right now this website will only consist of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

Depending on how many people participate, I might feature this on my Youtube channel @Brian Design and everyone can check the repository and see who contributed to it.
